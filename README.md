HEDM visualization tool.

This is the version that is intended to read the new data format consisting of matrices of pixels. Unfinished and not usable for this purpose.

Interactive Version!
Parameters used for narrowing down grains are just the euler angles, and thus the selection method still has room for noise.

Will try using Grayson's new code in a new branch to limit the displayed indices.
